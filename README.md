# Friendly Convos

## Description

The goal for this project was to create the back-end for a social media platform called Friendly Convos. It needed to have routes built out for CRUD operations with users as well as thoughts (i.e. posts) and the ability for users to add friends and for those friends to post reactions (replies) to their thoughts.
